## Let's Talk About the Future of the Web.

Say hello to a world where websites large and small are being crafted out of **TypeScript functions** and **React components**.

(Or perhaps we're all still living in the very large shadow of **WordPress**, but that's another story!)

Does that future appeal to you? Doesn't to me. Rather, if you care about **Ruby**, if you care about diverse **developer ecosystems**, if you want to use a Jamstack web framework that is **zero-config**, **simple to install**, and **surprisingly powerful** for a wide range of use cases, then say hello to [**Bridgetown**{:style="text-transform:uppercase"}](https://www.bridgetownrb.com){:target="_blank"}.

We recently unveiled [**a brand-new roadmap for Bridgetown**](https://www.bridgetownrb.com/future/roadmap-to-1.0/){:target="_blank"} as we look forward to our 1.0 release and on to 2022. When the project began in April 2020, the mission was clear: modernize and **reimagine Jekyll** as an exemplary Jamstack-style Ruby website framework which can **compete favorably with the best options on the market**.

We're getting there, but to leap over the finish line, **we need your help**.

## The State of Open Source Monetization
{:.serif}

In a [recent Netlify article](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2021/06/02/10-static-site-generators-to-watch-in-2021/) posted in June 2021, Jekyll still gets an honorable mention but is presented as something many people once loved but have since migrated away from for "similar alternatives" which offer a "more approachable" technology (aka JavaScript).

## RIP Jekyll ðŸ˜¢
{:.colorful}

I recently posted an article about the untimely demise of Jekyll. The gist of it this: .

But let's back up for a momentâ€¦why is this such a **big deal**?

Jekyll was once **the most popular Jamstack framework** in the world. Let that sink in for a moment.

Jekyll, a tool created by GitHub and written in Ruby, was **king of castle**. Only 6 years ago, in 2015, Matt Biilmann the CEO of Netlify [wrote an article for Smashing Magazine](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2015/11/16/smashing-magazine-static-website-generators-reviewed-jekyll-middleman-roots-hugo/) about this amazing new world of "static site generators". His examples were: Jekyll (written in Ruby), Middleman (written in Ruby), Roots, and Hugo.

In 2017, Netlify still reported Jekyll as the [#1 most popular static site generator in the world](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2017/05/25/top-ten-static-site-generators-of-2017/).

In a [recent Netlify article](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2021/06/02/10-static-site-generators-to-watch-in-2021/) posted in June 2021, Jekyll still gets an honorable mention but is presented as something many people once loved but have since migrated away from for "similar alternatives" which offer a "more approachable" technology (aka JavaScript).

If you deeply, truly care about keeping Ruby competitive as a language that can power world-class SSGs long into the future, this should be deeply concerning to you.

Thankfully, we have a way forward.
